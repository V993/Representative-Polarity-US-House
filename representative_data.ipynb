    "- **Sander Levin** is a representative from Michigan who at two points in his career represented two different districts in Michigan. From 1983-1993, he represented the **17th** district, and did not recieve any contributions (at least on file with the FEC). In 1993 he retired from the 17th district to campaign and win the **12th** district House seat for Michigan. This seat would later get redistricted to the **9th** district in 2012. In 2017, he announced he would not run for reelection in 2018. Instead, his son, Andy Levin, became his successor as the representative for the 9th district. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Alaska, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, and Delaware all have only **one seat** in the US House of Representatives. Different databases encode this single district number differently, as either 01, or 00. These needed to be manually recoded.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Year encodings** make matching on these datasets wildly difficult. The most confusing part of researching this part of my project was understanding electoral cycles (despite being a political science major in undergrad). I quickly realized that trying to match based on year would not work out for several reasons. Not only are electoral cycles measured slightly differently across different sources, but financial records for campaigns often encompass spending in the years leading up to an election and after, making matching much more difficult. This resulted in the current implementation, matching based on name, district, and state, a time-consuming and inefficient method of matching which takes a very long time. \n",
