    "### Bio Fields:\n",
    "- **icpsr**: Integer 1-99999. This is an ID code which identifies the member in question. In general, each member receives a single ICPSR identifier applicable to their entire career. A small number of members have received more than one- this can occur for members who have switched parties; as well as members who subsequently become president. Creating a new identifier allows a new NOMINATE estimate to be produced for separate appearances of a member in different roles.\n",
    "- **state_icpsr**: Integer 0-99. Identifier for the state represented by the member.\n",
    "- **district_code**: Integer 0-99. Identifier for the district that the member represents within their state (e.g. 3 for the Alabama 3rd Congressional District). Senate members are given district_code 0. Members who represent historical \"at-large\" districts are assigned 99, 98, or 1 in various circumstances.\n",
    "- **state_abbrev**: String. Two-character postal abbreviation for state (e.g. MO for Missouri).\n",
    "- **party_code**: Integer 1-9999. Identifying code for the member's party. Please see [documentation](https://voteview.com/articles/data_help_parties) for Party Data for more information about which party_code identifiers refer to which parties.\n",
    "- **occupancy**: Integer 1+. ICPSR occupancy code. This item is considered legacy or incomplete information and has not been verified. In general, members receive 0 if they are the only occupant, 1 if they are the first occupant, 2 if they are the second occupant, etc.\n",
    "- **last_means**: Integer 1-5. ICPSR Attain-Office Code. This is an indicator that reflects the member's last means of attaining office. This item is considered legacy or incomplete information and has not been verified. Members received 1 if they were elected in a general election, 2 if elected by special election, 3 if directly elected by a state legislature, and 5 if appointed.\n",
    "- **bioname**: String. Name of the member, surname first. For most members, agrees with the Biographical Directory of Congress.\n",
    "- **bioguide_id**: String. Member identifier in the Biographical Directory of Congress.\n",
    "- **born**: Integer. Year of member's birth.\n",
    "- **died**: Integer. Year of member's death.\n",
    "### Ideological Fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "We present two main estimates of a legislator's ideology: NOMINATE and Nokken-Poole. NOMINATE estimates assume that members occupy a static ideological position across the course of their career. Nokken-Poole estimates assume that each congress is completely separate for the purposes of estimating a member's ideology. We expect that most users of our data will primarily make use of the nominate_dim1 field, which reports the first dimension (often interpreted as economic liberalism-conservatism) of members as estimated by NOMINATE.\n",

    "- **geo_mean_probability**: Geometric mean probability of NOMINATE estimate.\n",
    "- **number_of_votes**: Number of votes cast by the member during a given congress.\n",
    "- **conditional**: Integer 0-1. A 1 indicates NOMINATE was estimated conditionally for a given member. 0 otherwise. Conditional estimation implies that an estimate is provisional and subject to updates when the next full estimation of NOMINATE scores occurs.\n",
    "- **nokken_poole_dim1**: Nokken-Poole First dimension estimate.\n",
