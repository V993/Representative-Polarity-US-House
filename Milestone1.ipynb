    "Congress has increasingly become more polarized and complicated in recent decades, and these preliminary investigations are a testament to that. Understanding and quantifying politicians specifically contextualized against one another could be a useful tool towards understanding where politicians lie (no pun intended), and how they can be described. \n"
